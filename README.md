# Live Transcribe
A lightweight web app that uses text-to-speech technology to transcribe spoken word in real time. I got the inspiration to do this while attending a Code for Atlanta Civic Hack Event. I refereced Wes Bos's Javascript 30 project and got the base javascript code from his project.

## Prerequisietes
I belive the web app only works on a Chrome browser. I have not tested it in any other browsers but will be doing some testing later on.

Other than that, the app itself is web-based and the only thing you need other than Chrome is internet access.

## Future Plans
I plan to add some additional features alongside the text-to-speech transcription including but not limited to:
- Microphone on/off button
- Color picker for the transcription canvas
- Export session transcription to a text file
